# 2.24.0 (2020-02-26)

# 2.23.1 (2020-02-24)

- Fixed an error in IE when retrieving a token. [#137](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/137)

# 2.23.0 (2020-02-21)

- Updated the authentication service to call a different service URL depending on the caller's domain. This resolves the infinite redirect loop experienced by some Safari users by assigning cookies on Blackbaud-owned domains that are not `blackbaud.com`. [#134](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/134) (Thanks @Acoulter18!)

# 2.22.0 (2020-02-04)

# 2.21.0 (2019-11-26)

- Added a `setTitle()` method to `BBOmnibar` to enable setting the window title while preserving the omnibar's selected service name and unread notification count in the title. [#116](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/116)

# 2.20.0 (2019-11-25)

- Added logic to notify the omnibar toast container of the page's current URL. [#118](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/118)

- Added logic to correctly format the zone when it is added to a tokenized URL. [#102](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/102) (Thanks @Blackbaud-JonathanBell!)

# 2.17.0 (2019-07-11)

- Added a `getUrl()` method to `BBAuth` that translates a 1BB tokenized URL and zone to a zoned URL. For example, a tokenized URL of `1bb://eng-hub00/version` and a zone of `eng-pusa01` translates to `https://eng-pusa01.app.blackbaud.net/hub00/version`. [#90](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/90)

# 2.16.0 (2019-06-27)

- Added a new "global" bundle that can be used to explicitly add `BBAuthClient` to the browser's global `window` object even when RequireJS or another runtime module loader is present. Also added ES2015 bundles that can be used in browsers that natively support ES2015. [#98](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/98)

# 2.15.1 (2019-06-13)

- Fixed `disableRedirect` logic for sites not hosted on a `blackbaud.com` domain. [#94](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/94) [#95](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/95)

# 2.15.0 (2019-06-06)

# 2.12.0 (2018-11-08)

- Updated token requests to allow legal entity ID to be specified with a permission scope; previously permission scope could only be specified if environment ID were specified. [#79](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/79)

# 2.11.0 (2018-10-31)

- Added `navVersion` config property. [#78](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/78)

# 2.10.0 (2018-10-01)

- Updated inactivity prompt to be shown with a higher z-index to avoid being covered up by a page's contents in more cases. [#75](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/75)

- Updated user activity session renewal logic to reflect new max session age value from BBID. [#73](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/73)

# 2.8.0 (2018-08-29)

- Added the ability to enforce legal entity context with `BBContextProvider`. [#71](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/71)

# 2.7.1 (2018-06-21)

- Fixed issue where user could be redirected to an error page if a pending request was interrupted. [#69](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/69)

# 2.7.0 (2018-06-14)

- Added interfaces and methods for theming the omnibar. [#67](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/67)

# 2.6.0 (2018-05-22)

- Added support for passing legal entity ID when retrieving a token. [#65](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/65)

# 2.5.0 (2018-05-09)

- Optimized the `BBAuth.getToken()` method by bypassing the CSRF endpoint which is no longer required by BBID. [#63](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/63)

# 2.4.0 (2018-04-17)

- Added `BBContextProvider` class which allows an application to ensure the proper context (such as environment ID) is supplied to the application either by automatically selecting a default context or by allowing the user to select a context. [#61](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/61)

# 2.3.0 (2018-03-22)

- Fixed accessibility issues. [#59](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/59)

# 2.2.0 (2017-11-29)

- The legacy keep-alive URL can now be set by the omnibar through the navigation service response instead of being specified at load time. The `legacyKeepAliveUrl` property of `BBOmnibarConfig` should now be considered deprecated and will be removed in a future major version. [#56](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/56)

# 2.1.0 (2017-11-08)

- Added ability to specify an environment ID when retrieving a token.  When not a member of the specified environment, the user will be redirected to an error page.  Specifying an environment ID also adds the environment ID to the JWT token so that consumers of the token can know the user is part of the specified environment.  Note that previously an environment ID could be specified but only when combined with a permission scope. [#59](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/55)

# 2.0.0 (2017-10-24)

- The 2.0.0 release introduces a few breaking changes, so upgrading to it will require changes to your code.

 - The `experimental` omnibar config option has been removed, and what was formerly referred to as the "experimental" omnibar is now the default omnibar.  To load the legacy omnibar (equivalent to not specifying the `experimental` flag in auth-client 1.x), use the new `BBOmnibarLegacy` class and call its `load()` rather than the `load()` method on `BBOmnibar`.

 - `BBAuth.getToken()` now only accepts an `args` parameter of type `BBAuthGetTokenArgs`.  Previously, the method overloaded the first argument to accept either an `args` parameter or a `forceNewToken` boolean parameter as well as a second `disableRedirect` parameter.  `forceNewToken` and `disableRedirect` should now be specified on the `args` object.

 - Several TypeScript config/DTO-style `class`es have been converted to `interface`s.  This keeps these types from being reified (i.e. generating a runtime artifact after transpilation to JavaScript) and results in a smaller bundle.  This should have no effect on your code unless you're doing something unusual like calling one of these type's constructors.

# 1.18.0 (2017-10-13)

- Added configuration option to omnibar to allow anonymous users to access pages that do not require authentication. [#49](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/49)

- Added basic support for a legacy keep-alive IFRAME when using the experimental omnibar. [#43](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/43)
- Ensure `menuEl` is a jQuery object before passing it through to the underlying omnibar widget. [#44](https://github.com/blackbaud/auth-client/pull/44)
